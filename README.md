# Sandwich Bot

## Overview
The Sandwich Bot is a decentralized trading bot built on the Solana blockchain using Rust smart contracts. It is designed to automate trading strategies by executing sandwich attacks, allowing users to capitalize on price movements in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

## Features
- **Automated Trading**: Executes buy and sell orders based on predefined strategies.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks market conditions and adjusts strategies dynamically.
- **Secure Transactions**: Utilizes Solanaâ€™s high-speed and low-cost transaction capabilities.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
git clone https://github.com/0xVictorDS/solana_sandwich_bot.git  
cd solana_sandwich_bot
2. **Build the Project**  
cargo build-bpf
3. **Deploy the Smart Contract**
## Configuration
Edit the configuration file `config.toml` to set your trading parameters:
The bot will begin monitoring transactions and executing trades based on your configuration.

## How It Works
The Sandwich Bot listens for pending transactions in the Solana mempool and executes its own transactions to "sandwich" target trades. This involves placing a buy order before a large transaction and a sell order immediately after, profiting from the price impact caused by the target transaction.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure that you do not expose your private keys.
- Regularly update your bot to incorporate security patches and improvements.
